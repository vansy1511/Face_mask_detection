# Face_mask_detection
Final project of Machine learning course about face mask detection using DenseNet201(classify model) and MTCNN(face detection model).)  

1. **About this project:** After the new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case spread rapidly in Wuhan-China in December 2019, World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that this is a dangerous virus which can be spreading from humans to humans through droplets and airborne. As for the prevention, wearing a face mask is essentials while going outside or meeting to others. However, some irresponsible people refuse to wear face mask with so many excuses. So it is necessary to build a model to determine whether someone is wearing a mask or not. This dataset is used for Face Mask Detection Classification with images.  

2. **Data Set:** From [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset)  
The dataset consists of almost 12K images which are almost 328.92MB in size. With two classes:     
- With mask.  
- Without mask.  

All the images with the face mask (~6K) are scrapped from google search and all the images without the face mask are preprocessed from the CelebFace dataset created by [Jessica Li](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530).
